Create an Express.js server that processes PUT `'/message/:id'` requests
and produces an SHA1 hash of the current date with the id.

For instance, if the server recieves

```
PUT /message/526aa677a8ceb64569c9d4fb
```

it will respond with a hash of the current date (as a string) and the id.

This could be computed like so:

```js
require('crypto')
  .createHash('sha1')
  .update(new Date().toDateString() + id)
  .digest('hex')
```

-----------------------------

## HINTS

Express.js apps can also be mounted to paths that contain a variable by
prepending a `:` to the beginning of a variable name. For instance, in 
the following, `app` handles PUT requests any subdirectory of `/path/`:

```js
app.put('/path/:NAME', function(req, res){ /* ... */ });
```

The given variable is then stored in the `req.params`. So, to extract
parameters from within the request handlers, use:

```js
req.params.NAME
```
